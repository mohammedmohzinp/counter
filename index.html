                and Google may sometimes display a longer or shorter snippet depending on the query and the content on
                the page. Additionally, Google may also generate its own meta description based on the search query if
                it determines that the page's original meta description is not relevant or informative enough. However,
                it's generally a good idea to aim for concise and compelling meta descriptions within the character
